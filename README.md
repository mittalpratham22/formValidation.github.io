# formValidation.github.io
In this project, the user input in a form is tested against a few conditions and generates an error for the user if those conditions are not fulfilled. The conditions are, if the username and password sections are empty, if the username has fewer than 5 characters. In this project, I have used technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
